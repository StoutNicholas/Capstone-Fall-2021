Our capstone project is about housing prices for the state of Arizona and local counties within the state. 
We have a data folder in which you will be able to explore and see all the data that we are going to use for our capstone project. 
we have chosen the MIT license because it gives us the user permission to reuse code for any purpose that we see fit for our project. The MIT license also allows us to work free from having any security or licensing restrictions that might come from Dataplanet or any other platform we use. 
You will see on our repository that we have an SRC file that will contain the images/results that we get from running our various model tests and prediction test. You will see the results via a screenshot or a download file that contains our results in a plot or graph of some form that we see fit for the moel we run.
